AUGUST COMBAT UPDATES:
1. Combat rounds and white attack
2. Replace mana with SP
3. Timed Effects (Both interval based and duration based)
4. Enemies flee at low health
5. Enemies can use Mixamo or Zoo animations

// ATTACHING WEAPONS IN BLENDER:
Select the armature and press tab for edit mode. Select the bone you want it to follow. Go back to object mode. Select MESH, THEN armature. Then parent but choose option for “bone”. If you don’t see it with control+p, try right clicking and I think you get more parenting options. This will parent the mesh to the specific bone selected.

Longterm updates:
- Break out enemy logic into components (FieldBehavior, CombatBehavior, Body, Vitals)?
- Leveling system
- UI for saving / loading
