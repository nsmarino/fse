// ATTACHING WEAPONS IN BLENDER:
Select the armature and press tab for edit mode. Select the bone you want it to follow. Go back to object mode. Select MESH, THEN armature. Then parent but choose option for “bone”. If you don’t see it with control+p, try right clicking and I think you get more parenting options. This will parent the mesh to the specific bone selected.


Still some work to be done on navmesh but i think i am finally on the right track
Would love to do post-processing at some point but let's see how far we can get with lights and fog
