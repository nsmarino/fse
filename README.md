// ATTACHING WEAPONS IN BLENDER:
Select the armature and press tab for edit mode. Select the bone you want it to follow. Go back to object mode. Select MESH, THEN armature. Then parent but choose option for “bone”. If you don’t see it with control+p, try right clicking and I think you get more parenting options. This will parent the mesh to the specific bone selected.
